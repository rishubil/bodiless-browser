# 😵 Bodiless Browser

**If there's a Headless Browser, shouldn't someone make a Bodiless Browser too?**

## 🎯 What does this do?

A web browser that does what Headless Browser doesn't do.

When you enter a URL, it shows you:
- HTTP status (200, 404, 500, etc.)
- Page title
- Response time
- Content size
- That's it.

No rendering. No JavaScript execution. No complex features.
